Canopy Cover Assessment in Costa Rica Forests using Leaf Gap Fraction Analysis and Hemispherical Photography

![hemispherical image](plots/clustered_image.png)

This script uses a kmeans clustering algorithm to identify leaves from a background of sky. The photos are then processed to dotermine what percent of the canopy is leaf. The results are then used to compare canopy cover among four different parks in Costa Rica.
